By: Ayn (with some help from GPT of course)

## Introduction

Pain Budgeter is a simple tool I made specificially to track my own expenses, after I got tired of using excel to track all the money I waste of snacks (rip). Put simply it's meant to be a flutter crash course for me.

## Features

1. An Sqlite Database

2. Real-time Currency conversion using web scraping

3. Gives a total sum of all entries currently present on the screen at the moment

4. UUID based ids for each entry in the database

## Future Updates

I plan to add more features and make it a bit more optimized soon enough
